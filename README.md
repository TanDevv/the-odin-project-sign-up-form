## Overview

## My process

Took some time to do a project from The Odin Project. This one was a simple sign-up form but I added my own designs and colors to make it more of my own!

I will start with the style-guide.md file. Then I will try to gauge what fonts were used in which areas awhile making my --custom properties.

I had fairly no trouble creating this project, it was nice practice to get more into making forms and working with the HTML tags as well, this was the first time I had styled a website with form sections. I am happy with my results.

While developing this website, I have come to realise that I feel ready to delve into Javascript finally, as I am finding more and more the wish to implement features on my projects that are only possible with JS. This may be my last project with just HTML/CSS/SASS. It is a nice way to continue my journey into web development by doing a nice project like this. :)
